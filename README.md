## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## About

This is boilerplate I have created to learn, to try, to evaluate how thing works, but I hope you can use it for yourself too.
In this repo you can find a lot of parts of code from another similar projects.
It's far from being complete, there is a lot of dependencies I want to use in future, but until now didn't have time to.

## Running Dev Server

NPM scripts are optimized for running on windows machines,
for mac/unix system you have to make little tweaks

```bash
//first command line
npm run start:dev

//second command line
npm run start:hot

```

## To Be Done?

* optimize isomorphic fetching?
* react-helmet?
* immutable?
* styles (css-modules ???)
